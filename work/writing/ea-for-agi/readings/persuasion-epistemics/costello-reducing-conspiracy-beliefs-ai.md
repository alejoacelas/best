Abstract: Conspiracy theory beliefs are notoriously persistent. Influential theories propose they
fulfill important psychological needs, thus resisting counterevidence. Yet previous failures in
correcting conspiracy beliefs may be due to counterevidence being insufficiently compelling and
tailored. To evaluate this possibility, we leverage developments in generative artificial
intelligence and engaged 2,190 conspiracy believers in personalized evidence-based dialogues
with GPT-4 Turbo. The intervention reduced conspiracy belief by ~20%. The effect remained 2
months later, generalized across a wide range of conspiracy theories, and occurred even among
participants with deeply entrenched beliefs. Although the dialogues focused on a single
conspiracy, they nonetheless diminished belief in unrelated conspiracies and shifted conspiracyrelated behavioral intentions. These findings suggest that many conspiracy theory
believers can revise their views if presented with sufficiently compelling evidence.

Main Text: Widespread belief in unsubstantiated or false conspiracy theories is both a major
source of public concern and focus of scholarly research (1–3). Conspiracy theories – in which
events are understood as being caused by secret, malevolent plots involving powerful
conspirators – are often quite implausible, yet a large fraction of the world has come to believe
them, including as much as 50% of the US population by past estimates (4–7). Such prevalence
is particularly concerning, given that conspiracy belief is often used as a paradigmatic example
of resistance to evidence (8–10): there is little evidence of interventions that successfully debunk
conspiracies among people who already believe them (11, 12).
The apparent resilience of conspiracy theories in the face of clear counter-evidence poses a
powerful challenge to scientific theories that emphasize the role of reasoning in belief formation
and revision (13, 14). Instead, belief in conspiracies has primarily been explained through socialpsychological processes thought to blunt rational decision-making and receptivity to evidence (7,
15–19). Popular explanations propose that people adopt conspiracy theories to sate underlying
psychic “needs” or motivations, such as the desire for control over one’s environment and
experiences (15), certainty and predictability (20), security and stability (21), and uniqueness
(22). If these psychological needs are met by believing in conspiracy theories, the beliefs become
more than just opinions; they become mechanisms for psychological equilibrium – and thus are
argued to be highly resistant to counterevidence (1, 3, 23). Coupled with peoples’ motivations to
maintain their identity and/or group memberships, with which conspiracies also interface (24–
26), believers may use specific forms of biased information processing (motivated reasoning)
where counterevidence is selectively ignored (27–29).
These perspectives, which center the psychological drives of those who believer conspiracies,
paint a grim picture for countering conspiratorial beliefs: Because conspiracy believers at some
level “want” to believe, convincing them to abandon unfounded beliefs using facts should be
virtually impossible (without more fundamentally altering their underlying psychology and
identity commitments).
Here, we question this conventional wisdom about conspiracy theories and ask whether it may,
in fact, be possible to talk people out of the conspiratorial “rabbit hole” with sufficiently
compelling evidence. Leveraging recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we
shed new light on whether counterevidence reduces belief in conspiracy theories. We
hypothesize that fact-based interventions may appear to fall short due to a lack of depth and
personalization of the corrective information. Entrenched conspiracy theorists are often quite
knowledgeable about their conspiracy of interest, deploying prodigious (albeit often erroneous or
misinterpreted) lists of evidence in support of the conspiracy that can leave skeptics outmatched
in debates and arguments (30, 31). Furthermore, people believe a wide range of conspiracies, and
the specific evidence brought to bear in support of even a particular conspiracy theory may differ
substantially from believer to believer. Canned debunking attempts that argue broadly against a
given conspiracy theory may, therefore, be ineffective because they fail to address the specific
evidence held by the believer – and thus fail to be convincing.
In contrast, we hypothesize that LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges because
they possess two key capabilities: (i) access to a vast amount of information across diverse
topics, and (ii) the ability to tailor counterarguments to specific conspiracies, reasoning, and
evidence the believer brings to bear (32). These capabilities allow LLMs to respond directly to –
2

and refute – the particular evidence supporting an individual’s conspiratorial beliefs. In so doing,
LLMs can potentially overcome the heterogeneity in conspiracy beliefs and supporting evidence
that we hypothesize have stymied previous debunking efforts.

To test whether LLMs can effectively refute conspiracy beliefs – or whether psychological needs
and motivations render conspiracy believers impervious to counterevidence – we develop a
pipeline for conducting behavioral science research using real-time, personalized interactions
between research subjects and LLMs. In our experiments, participants articulate a conspiracy
theory in which they believe – in their own words – along with the evidence they think supports
the theory. They then engage in a back-and-forth interaction with an artificial intelligence (AI)
implemented using the LLM GPT-4 Turbo (33). In line with our theorizing around the unique
capacities of LLMs for debunking conspiracies, we prompt the AI to use its store of knowledge
to try to respond to the specific evidence raised by the participant and reduce the participant’s
belief in the conspiracy theory (or, in a control condition, participants converse with AI about an
unrelated topic). In particular, the AI was instructed to “very effectively persuade” users against
belief in their chosen conspiracy, allowing it to flexibly adapt its strategy based on the
participant’s unique arguments and evidence. To further enhance this tailored approach, we
provided the AI with each participant’s written conspiracy rationale as the conversation’s
opening message, along with the participant’s initial rating of their belief in the conspiracy. This
design choice directed the AI’s attention to refuting specific claims, while simulating a more
natural dialogue where the participant had already articulated their viewpoint. For the full
prompts given to the model, see Table S2. The conversation lasted 8.4 minutes on average and
comprised three rounds of back-and-forth interaction (not counting the initial elicitation of
reasons for belief from the participant), a length chosen to balance the need for substantive
dialogue with pragmatic concerns around study length and participant engagement.
This design allows us to test whether tailored persuasive communication is indeed able to reduce
already-held conspiracy beliefs; how the effectiveness of such communication varies based on
factors such as the intensity of the preexisting belief, the participant’s subscription to a more
general conspiratorial mindset, the importance of the conspiracy to the participant’s life, and the
content of the specific conspiracy theory articulated by the participants; and whether any such
persuasion spills over to other related beliefs and behaviors. Finally, our design produces rich
textual data from thousands of conversations between the AI and the human participants
(https://8cz637-thc.shinyapps.io/ConspiracyDebunkingConversations), which we analyze to gain
insight into what the humans believe and how the LLM engages in persuasion.

Figure 1. Design and flow of the human-AI dialogues. Respondents (yellow) described a conspiracy theory
they believed in, along with the evidence they thought supported it. Each response was fed-forward to a query
instructing the AI model (GPT-4 Turbo, shown in purple) to generate a brief, relatively standardized statement
of that conspiracy. Participants then rated their belief in the summary statement, yielding our pre-treatment
measure (0-100 scale, with 0 being “definitely false”, 50 being “uncertain” and 100 being “definitely true”).
All respondents then entered into a conversation with the AI model (treatment argued against the conspiracy
theory’s veracity, control discussed relevant topics). Following three rounds of dialogue, respondents once
4

again rated their belief in the summarized conspiracy statement, serving as our post-treatment measure.
Shown is an example treatment dialogue which led the participant to substantially reduce their belief.

In Study 1, participants indicated their belief in 15 popular conspiracy theories (from the Belief
in Conspiracy Theories Index, BCTI), completed a distractor task, and were then asked to
identify and describe a particular conspiracy theory they believed in (not necessarily one of the
15 rated earlier) as well as providing details about evidence or experiences supporting their
belief. In real time, the AI created a summary statement of each participant’s free-text
conspiratorial belief description, and each participant was then asked to indicate their belief in
the AI summary of their conspiracy statement – providing a pre-treatment measure of belief.
This open-ended measurement approach avoids a longstanding criticism of discrete conspiracism
measures, such as the BCTI, for failing to representatively sample from the universe of possible
conspiracies (34).
Out of N=1,055 American participants (quota-matched to the U.S. census on age, gender, race,
and ethnicity) who completed the pre-treatment measures, 72.2% indicated belief in a conspiracy
theory and were included in our subsequent analyses, whereas 20.6% said they did not believe
any conspiracy theories or described a belief that the AI classified as not actually conspiratorial
(for coding validation, see Supplementary Materials, SM, section 1 and Table S4), 3.5%
described a conspiracy theory but had belief below the scale midpoint, and 3.6% described a
conspiracy theory that was inaccurately summarized by the AI.
To assess whether the AI could reduce conspiracy beliefs, participants were then randomly
assigned to either have a 3-round conversation with the AI about their favored conspiracy belief
(treatment group, 60% of the sample) or to participate in a similarly structured conversation
about a neutral topic (control group, 40% of the sample). Although past work has typically found
that people are less receptive to corrections (35), advice (36), and persuasion (37) labeled as
coming from AI, we opted to avoid deception and explicitly informed participants that they were
interacting with an AI.
For each participant, the AI was (a) provided with that participant’s specific open-ended
response, including their stated rationale for believing the conspiracy theory and their degree of
endorsement and (b) prompted to use simple language to persuade the user that their conspiracy
theory is not supported and change their beliefs to be less conspiratorial. Following the
conversations, all participants re-rated belief in their stated conspiracy theory and the BCTI items
(see Figure 1 for key methodological steps and a sample conversation).
Was conversing with an AI able to successfully reduce participants’ conspiratorial beliefs?
Indeed, the treatment reduced participants’ belief in their stated (i.e., focal) conspiracy by 16.8
points more than the control (linear regression with robust standard errors controlling for pretreatment belief, 95% CI [13.8, 19.7], p < .001, d = 1.15; Figure 2a and SM section 2). This
translates into a 21.43% decrease in belief among those in treatment (vs. 1.04% in the control).
Furthermore, over a quarter (27.4%) of participants in the treatment became uncertain in their
conspiracy belief (i.e. belief below the scale midpoint) following the conversation, compared to
only 2.4% in the control. We also find a significant effect when examining the subset of focal
conspiracies (n = 303) that strongly resembled BCTI items, using the pre- and post-treatment
5

BCTI ratings as opposed to the pre- and post-treatment evaluations of the AI summary (b = 12.04, 95% CI [-16.63, -7.46], p < .001, d = .70; see SM Section 2.1), indicating the robustness
of the results to our measurement approach.

To assess the persistence of this effect, we recontacted participants 10 days and 2 months later
for a short follow-up in which they once again completed the outcome measures. We find no
significant change in belief in the focal conspiracy theory from immediately after the AI
conversation to either 10 days or 2 months later in a mixed-effects model with fixed effects for
experimental condition and time point and random intercepts for participants (bΔImmediatelyPost 10Days = 0.63, 95% CI [-2.72, 1.46], p = .56; bΔImmediatelyPost - 2Months = 0.03, 95% CI [-2.24, 2.31], p
= .98; Figure 2A and Table S9). This result is robust to assuming that the 14% of participants
who did not complete the follow-up returned to their initial pre-treatment belief levels (b = 12.70
95% CI [9.47, 15.93], p < .001). Thus, the change in beliefs we observe is remarkably persistent.
However, in Study 1, the proportion of participants who endorsed a conspiracy via free-text
response was somewhat higher than prior estimates of the American public (4). Given that
participants in Study 1 completed the BCTI before supplying their conspiracy theory, it is
possible that exposure to the BCTI items increased the salience of particular conspiracy theories,
and thereby increased reported belief.

We explore this possibility, as well as the replicability of our results and robustness to minor
design changes, in Study 2 where N=2,286 Americans completed an extremely similar procedure
without the BCTI. We also changed the wording for the conspiracy elicitation prompt such that,
instead of directly asking participants which conspiracy theories they believed in, we provided a
definition of what a conspiracy theory is and asked participants if they found any such theories
compelling. Finally, we disabled copy-paste functionality to guard against participants
themselves using LLMs to complete the study (38). Here, 64.6% of participants indicated belief
in a conspiracy theory (see Table S3). Most importantly, we replicate the experimental results of
Study 1. Participants in the treatment in Study 2 reduced belief in their focal conspiracy by 12.3
points more than participants in the control (95% CI [10.07, 14.72], p < .001, d = 0.79; Figure
2B and Table S8), translating into a 19.41% average decrease in belief (versus a 2.94% decrease
in the control).
Further demonstrating the robustness of our results, we also replicated our findings in a
supplemental study conducted using a sample recruited through the participant supplier Lucid (b
= -10.99, 95% CI [-16.09, -5.88], p < .001, d = .53; see SM section 8 and Figure S13), which
provides relatively inattentive respondents who mostly do non-academic surveys (39). Thus, the
effect is not unique to attentive and engaged participants from Cloud Connect.

Next, we examine the robustness of the AI conversation treatment effect. We begin by
investigating whether the treatment size varies across the specific focal conspiracy theories
articulated by the participants. To do so, we used a multi-step natural language processing and
clustering approach to classify each focal conspiracy theory according to its contents (see SM
section 3). We find that the treatment effect did not differ significantly across conspiracy type in
an omnibus test (F[12, 1971] = 1.30, p = .21), and that the treatment significantly decreased
belief across all but one of the 12 different types of conspiracy theory identified with > 1%
prevalence in the sample (Figure 2c). Notably, the treatment worked even for highly salient –
and likely deeply entrenched – political conspiracies such as those involving fraud in the 2020
US Presidential Election (b = 10.61 [5.54, 15.67], p < .001, d = .82) and the COVID-19
pandemic (b = 11.79 [6.98, 16.60], p < .001, d = .73). In addition to allowing us to test for the
robustness of our treatment, this classification based on the participant’s open-ended responses
also provides novel descriptive insight into which particular conspiracy theories Americans
subscribe to. Alternative specifications of this clustering solution yielded highly similar patterns
(see SM section 3.1; Figures S6-S7).
We now turn to variation in effect sizes across individuals. In particular, we ask whether the
treatment is effective even among participants likely to have particularly entrenched beliefs. We
use generalized additive models (GAMs) to analyze how the treatment effect varies in a nonlinear manner based on several measures relevant to entrenchment. First, we examine
participants’ level of pre-treatment belief in the focal conspiracy, and find that it does
significantly moderate the treatment effect, resulting in a u-shaped curve (ΔAIC = -3.25, ΔR2 =
.002, p = .022; Figure 3A and Table S14). Second, we examine how important participants
indicated the conspiracy theory is to their worldview (Figure 3B and Table S15), which does
significantly decrease the size of the treatment effect (ΔAIC = 3.12, ΔR2 = .003, p = .025).
Critically, however, the effect was significant even among those who indicated the highest level
of importance (b = 5.84 [0.33, 11.35], p = .038, d = .53). Third, we examined participants’ level
of general conspiratorial ideation (i.e. the intensity with which they believed BCTI conspiracies),
which showed non-significant moderation of the treatment effect (ΔAIC = 0.77, ΔR2 = .002, p =
.108; Figure 3C and Table S16). Participants at or above the 90th percentile of conspiratorial
ideation in our sample (i.e., endorsing virtually all of the 15 diverse conspiracy statements) still
displayed a substantial average treatment effect of b = 9.07 (95% CI [2.73, 15.44], p = .006, d =
.53).

Figure 3. The treatment is effective even for those who are strongly attached to their conspiracy beliefs. Shown is the change in belief
in the focal conspiracy from before AI conversation to after AI conversation, for the treatment (red) and control (blue) conditions. Data
are pooled across studies to maximize power. Individual observations are plotted along with fit lines and 95% confidence intervals
generated using generalized additive models. We conduct separate analyses for predictors of participant’s pre-treatment level of belief in
the focal conspiracy (A), rating of how important the focal conspiracy is to their personal beliefs or understanding of the world (B), and
general conspiratorial mindset as measured by average belief in 15 conspiracies from the Belief in Conspiracy Theories Index completed
pre-treatment (C).

We also examine moderation by demographic characteristics (age, race, gender, education) and
other individual difference variables (political orientation, political extremism, religiosity,
familiarity with generative AI, usage of generative AI, trust in generative AI, and institutional
trust). In a single linear regression model including all candidate moderators and their interaction
with experimental condition, as well as a control for conspiracy type and its interaction with
experimental condition, only (a) trust in generative AI and (b) institutional trust consistently
moderated the treatment effect, such that those higher in both kinds of trust showed larger
treatment effects (see Tables S17-18). We conducted a post hoc analysis using the causal forest
method (40) to further clarify and identify heterogeneous effects of the intervention across all
moderators (including conspiracy type, pre-treatment beliefs, and importance) (see SM section
4.3). Variable importance analyses indicated that, for Experiment 1, the predominant
determinants of treatment effect heterogeneity (in order) were participant’s age, trust in
generative AI, and BCTI scores; in Experiment 2, these were institutional trust (which was not
measured in Experiment 1), trust in generative AI, age, and conspiracy-importance. Critically,
while there were heterogeneous treatment effects across subgroups (t = 4.97, p < .001), the
conditional average treatment effects (CATE) across covariate profile subgroups ranged from 20.54 to -6.56 – implying that the treatment reduced belief for all subgroups. For example, the
CATE ranged from -17.7 to -4.5 (median = -9.7) for individuals who rated their focal conspiracy
belief as “extremely important” to their personal beliefs; from -13.6 to -6.7 (median = -9.8) for
individuals with minimal trust in AI; and from -18.2 to -10.0 (median = -15.4) for individuals
with 95th percentile and above BCTI scores.

Next, we examined treatment effects on outcomes beyond belief in the focal conspiracy. First,
we ask whether the treatment effect affected individuals’ beliefs in conspiracy theories that were
not discussed during the conversation with the AI model (see SM sections 2 and 7). We did so by
analyzing respondents' belief in 15 widespread conspiracy theories from the BCTI (which is
assessed by both pre-treatment and post-treatment in Study 1). We employed a linear mixed
model with fixed effects for experimental conditions and time point (pre, post, 10-day, 2-months)
and random intercepts for participant. Post-intervention, there was a 3.05-point decrease in
general conspiracy beliefs in the active condition (95% CI [-3.90, -2.20], p < .001, 8.2%
decrease; Figure 4A and Table S10), compared to a 1.64-point increase in the control (d = .21).
This effect was still evident at the 2-month follow-up, with a 2.46-point decrease from pretreatment (95% CI [-3.44, -1.49], p < .001). When only analyzing belief in BCTI conspiracy
theories that a given participant believed pre-treatment (i.e. endorsed above the scale midpoint),
the impact was more pronounced: a 9.39-point reduction immediately post-intervention (95% CI
[-11.06, -7.72], p < .001, 12% decrease, Figure 4B and Table S11), compared to a 3.32-point
reduction in the control (d = 0.53). This difference between treatment and control persisted at the
2-month follow-up (bΔTreatment - Control = -5.34, 95% CI [-8.40, -2.29], p < .001).

10

5

In Study 2, we investigated the treatment’s influence on participants' behavioral intentions (see
SM section 5). We found that the treatment significantly increased intentions to ignore or
unfollow social media accounts espousing the focal conspiracy (𝛃 = .39 [.27, .50], p < .001;
Figure 4C and Table S19) and significantly increased willingness to ignore or argue against
people who believe the focal conspiracy (𝛃 = .42 [.31, .54], p < .001; Figure 4D and Table S20).
There was a directional but non-significant decrease in intentions to join pro-conspiracy protests
(𝛃 = -.12 [-.27, .03], p = .12; Figure 4E and Table S21) – intentions which were low at baseline,
potentially creating a floor effect.

How accurate is the AI?

15

20

25

Although it was not possible for us to ensure that all the claims produced by the AI in our
experiment were accurate, we hired a professional fact-checker to evaluate the veracity and
potential bias of all 128 claims made by GPT-4-turbo across representative example
conversations from each of the 11 major conspiracy clusters generated by participants in our
experiments. Of these claims, 127 (99.2%) were rated as “true”, 1 (0.8%) as “misleading” and 0
as “false”; and none of the claims were found to contain liberal or conservative bias. Together
with a recent benchmarking study that found only 2.5% of the claims produced by GPT-4-turbo
when summarizing text were hallucinations (41), these findings give us reason to believe that the
information provided by the AI in our studies was largely accurate. Furthermore, in 1.2% of
cases the participant named a focal conspiracy that is unambiguously true (e.g., MK Ultra). In
these cases, the treatment effect was non-significant and directionally positive (b = 6.51, 95% CI
[-39.42, 52.45], p = .76, d = .43), and significantly different from the effect for the other
conspiracies (bΔTrue - False Consiracies = -20.57, 95% CI [-33.14, -8.00], p = .001; see SM Section
2.3).

Discussion

5

10

While conspiracy theories are widely seen as a paradigmatic example of beliefs that rarely
change in response to evidence (8–10), we hypothesized that dialogues with large language
models – which can use facts and evidence to rebut the specific claims made by any given
conspiracy believer – would be efficacious in debunking conspiracy beliefs. Our findings
confirmed this prediction: a brief interaction with a pre-trained large language model
substantially reduced belief in a wide range of conspiracy theories. The robustness of this effect
is particularly noteworthy: (i) it occurred for both conspiracies that participants articulated in
their own words and a broader conspiratorial worldview, (ii) it was evident even among
participants with strong commitment to their chosen conspiracy, and (iii) its impact persisted,
virtually undiminished, for (at least) two months after the intervention. Dialogues with the AI
produced a meaningful and enduring shift in beliefs among a meaningful proportion of
committed conspiracy believers in our study.

Theoretical, practical, and methodological advances

Our findings fundamentally challenge the view that evidence and arguments are of little use once
someone has “gone down the rabbit hole” and come to believe a conspiracy theory. They also
call into question social-psychological theories that center psychological “needs” and
motivations as primary drivers of conspiratorial belief (1, 15, 42). Instead, our results align more
closely with an alternative theoretical perspective that posits a central role for analytic thinking
in protecting against epistemically suspect beliefs and behaviors (14), such as superstitions and
paranormal beliefs (43), misinformation (44) and pseudo-profound bullshit (45). This viewpoint
suggests that reasoning is not unduly constrained by identity needs and non-accuracy
motivations; rather, people are generally willing to update their beliefs when presented with
compelling evidence (46). Our study supports this perspective in several ways. Most
straightforwardly, many conspiracists – including those strongly committed to their beliefs –
updated their views when confronted with an AI that argued compellingly against their positions.
Further, the AI primarily provided alternative, non-conspiratorial explanations and evidence
while encouraging critical thinking, rather than attempting to satisfy psychological needs (see
SM Section 6). The durability of our findings across two months, along with the intervention’s
spillover effects on unrelated conspiracies and behavioral intentions, also suggests that
participants seriously considered and internalized the AI's arguments—consistent with the
“central route” to persuasion (47), which is known to promote durable belief change (and in
contrast to the “peripheral route” which leverages superficial identity cues or emotional appeals,
and produces more ephemeral changes). Of course, our results do not wholly rule out some role
for needs and motivations in the formation and maintenance of conspiracy beliefs, but they do
indicate an important (perhaps countervailing, in some cases) role for evidence-based
deliberation—especially in challenging and changing these beliefs once they are established. It is
important to note that our goal – refuting existing conspiratorial beliefs – is distinct from other
related challenges which have received more attention in the literature. These include presenting
and then debunking pro-conspiracy arguments (48, 49), attempting to increase resistance to
conspiracy theories in general (50, 51), and presenting arguments against a specific conspiracy
theory to randomly selected crowd workers (52–55), which have been targeted with modest
success by past work (e.g. meta-analytic g = 0.16 across 273 effect sizes) (12).

Our findings also have practical implications. Most broadly—in contrast to notions of a “posttruth” world in which facts no longer matter—arguments and evidence should not be abandoned
by those seeking to reduce belief in dubious conspiracy theories. More specifically, AI models
are powerful, flexible tools for reducing epistemically suspect beliefs and have the potential to
be deployed to provide accurate information at scale. For example, internet search terms related
to conspiracies could be met with an AI-generated summaries of accurate information—tailored
to the precise search—that solicit the user’s response and engagement. Similarly, AI-powered
social media accounts could reply to users who share inaccurate conspiracy-related content
(providing corrective information for the potential benefit of both the poster and observers).
Consistent with the potential for uptake of AI dialogues, some conspiracy-believing respondents
in our sample expressed excitement and appreciation in their conversations with the AI (e.g.,
“Now this is the very first time I have gotten a response that made real, logical, sense. I must
admit this really shifted my imagination when it comes to the subject of Illuminati. I think it was
extremely helpful in my conclusion of rather the Illuminati is actually real.”). However, it is
quite unlikely that all, or even many, entrenched believers will choose to engage with AI
chatbots. Exploring a variety of short- and long-term strategies to encourage engagement—such
as gamification, transparency efforts (e.g., disclosing the AI model prompt and fine-tuning;
clearly labelling sources), incentive programs, anonymous interaction options, and the
integration of AI-assisted critical thinking exercises into school curricula—is an important
direction for future applied work.
The effectiveness of AI persuasion demonstrated in our studies also relates to ongoing debates
regarding the promise versus peril of generative AI (56, 57). In our experiments, we sought to
use AI to increase the accuracy of people’s beliefs by debunking conspiracy theories. Absent
appropriate guardrails, however, it is entirely possible that such models could also convince
people to adopt epistemically suspect beliefs (58) – or be used as tools of large-scale persuasion
more generally (59). Thus, our findings emphasize both the potential positive impacts of
generative AI when deployed responsibly, and the crucial, pressing importance of minimizing
opportunities for this technology to be used irresponsibly. One especially key outstanding
question, with far-reaching implications for AI’s impact on the global information ecosystem, is
the degree of (a)symmetry in the efficacy of AI-based rational persuasion for true versus false
content.
Finally, the experimental paradigm presented in this paper represents a substantial
methodological advancement in behavioral science. Traditional survey experiments typically
rely on static, predetermined stimuli and questions, which limits their ability to probe and
respond to individuals’ beliefs (60). In contrast, the real-time use of LLMs embedded in a survey
enables the researcher to elicit open-ended statements of belief (or anything else) and translate
them into quantitative outcomes (61). As we have seen, AI can engage in back-and-forth
dialogues with participants, adapting its responses based on the specific information provided by
each individual (as opposed to, for example, using LLMs to pre-generate static stimuli as in past
work) (62–66). This personalized approach is particularly valuable when studying complex
phenomena such as conspiracy beliefs, where a one-size-fits-all intervention may be less
effective (11, 12, 55, 67). The open-ended nature of the human-AI conversations also produces
rich textual data that can be analyzed using natural language processing or qualitative techniques
(68), which allows researchers to gain deeper insights into the content and structure of
participants’ beliefs, as well as the strategies employed by the AI to challenge those beliefs.

Integrating human-LLM interactions into behavioral science has the potential to meaningfully
enhance our understanding of complex psychological phenomena.
Limitations and future directions

Although our results are promising, there are important limitations to highlight. Our study
primarily relied on American online survey respondents who chose to participate in studies for
material compensation, which raises questions about generalizability. Future work should test
whether our findings extend to conspiracy believers who do not typically participate in survey
studies, as well as to populations from countries and cultures beyond the United States. While
many participants in our study expressed maximal confidence in their conspiracy beliefs, it also
remains to be seen whether AI dialogues would effectively change the beliefs of even more
entrenched conspiracy adherents, such as those actively participating in conspiracy-related
groups or events. Moreover, our use of GPT-4 Turbo, a frontier, closed-source, pre-trained, and
fine-tuned language model, presents challenges related to interpretability and replicability (69–
71). While GPT-4 demonstrated both high accuracy and persuasiveness, serving as a proof of
concept for AI-driven debunking, it remains unknown whether other models would perform
similarly along either or both dimensions (72). This uncertainty extends to the potentially
interactive relationship between accuracy and persuasive capacity: hallucinations or lies may
afford more compelling arguments, allowing models with less restrictive guardrails to
outcompete heavily moderated models such as GPT-4 on persuasion. Finally, the causal
mechanisms underpinning our results remain unformalized. While our study demonstrates the
effectiveness of AI-facilitated dialogues in changing conspiracy beliefs, the specific cognitive or
psychological processes through which this change occurs are unusually difficult to confirm—
each conversation was unique and contained an admixture of rational argumentation and social
cues. Both qualitative examination of the conversations and a structured, NLP-based analysis of
the persuasive strategies used by the AI (see SM Section 6) suggest that fact-based
argumentation was the focal point of each interaction; future research should examine this in
greater detail.
Conclusion

30

35

It has become almost a truism that people “down the rabbit hole” of conspiracy belief are almost
impossible to reach. In contrast to this pessimistic view, we have shown that a relatively brief
conversation with a generative AI model can produce a large and lasting decrease in conspiracy
beliefs, even among people whose beliefs are deeply entrenched. It may be that it has proven so
difficult to dissuade people from their conspiracy beliefs because they simply have not been
given good enough counterevidence. This paints a picture of human reasoning that is
surprisingly optimistic: even the deepest of rabbit holes may have an exit. Conspiracists are not
necessarily blinded by psychological needs and motivations – it just takes a genuinely strong
argument to reach them.

All studies began by obtaining informed consent from participants. After the studies were
completed, all participants were debriefed and informed about the limitations and constraints of
generative AI models. All studies were deemed minimal risk and exempt by the MIT Committee
on the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects (protocol E-5539).
We excluded participants for inattentiveness (both before they entered the study, using an openended text response, and early on in the study before random assignment using an attention
check item). All studies were preregistered (see aspredicted.org/RPG_RY9,
aspredicted.org/HSD_41Q, aspredicted.org/KSN_PNL). Any non-pre-registered analyses are
labeled “post hoc” and any deviations from the pre-registrations are reported. Conversational
data from all participants, including those removed from our analyses, is available via web
application. All GPT-4 model prompts used during the experiment are provided in Table S2.

Participants
We preregistered a target sample of 1,000 responses from CloudResearch’s Connect participant
pool. In total, 1190 individuals began the survey (this includes 75 participants from a pilot
conducted prior to the pre-registration; for completeness, we include these participants in our
analyses, but excluding them does not qualitatively change the results). An initial (pre-treatment)
screener only allowed participants who passed a permissive writing quality and coherence
screener to continue and complete the survey. The purpose of this screening criterion was to
ensure that participants were not using automated survey completion programs, were capable of
reading and writing in English, and were willing to answer the sort of open-ended questions on
which the intervention relies. Of the participants who entered the survey, 70 failed this writing
screener. A further 13 participants failed pre-treatment attention checks and were removed from
the survey; 86 discontinued prior to reaching the treatment. Further, using preregistered criteria,
we excluded 157 participants who did not supply a genuine conspiracy theory (e.g., by noting
that they do not believe any conspiracy theories in the open-ended response), 56 participants
who provided a genuine conspiracy theory but endorsed it at below 50% veracity, and 55
participants for whom the AI provided an inaccurate summary (see SI section 1 and Figure S2).
Thus, 774 participants were included in our analyses (although all who passed the writing
screener were allowed to complete the experiment). The overall attrition rate was 1.8%. Using a
logistic regression model predicting whether or not a person attrited, we find no evidence of
differential rates of attrition in treatment vs. control (b = -.53, p = .37). The treatment sample
(mean age = 45.7, mean ideology = 3.04 on a scale from 1 [liberal] to 6 [conservative]) included
383 males, 384 females, and 7 participants who selected another gender option. A balance check
found that our sample was balanced on pre-treatment covariates (see Table S1). This study was
run on 19-22 January 2024 and took 30.98 minutes on average to complete.
Procedure

40

Pre-treatment measures. Participants completed a battery of self-report measures concerning
their endorsement of a diverse set of 15 conspiracy beliefs, their attitudes concerning artificial
16

5

10

intelligence, and demographic items including beliefs about politics and religion. Conspiracy
beliefs were assessed using a modified version of Belief in Conspiracy Theories Inventory (α =
.90; example item: “Government agencies in the UK are involved in the distribution of illegal
drugs to ethnic minorities”) (73), which updated several items to reflect contemporary versions
of the original (e.g., “SARS” was swapped with “COVID-19”). The scale labels ranged from “0
(Definitely False)” to “25 (Probably False)” to “50 (Uncertain)” to “75 (Probably True)” to “100
(Definitely True)”, with the mean score in the treatment sample being 38.6% (SD = 20.0%). In
addition to the 15 false conspiracy theories comprising the BCTI, we included 3 true conspiracy
theories (pertaining to Project MK Ultra, Operation Northwoods, and the tobacco industry).
Attitudes concerning artificial intelligence were measured using items adapted from a Pew
survey (74).
Subsequently, participants responded to an open-ended question concerning a conspiracy theory
that they support (which we refer to as the “focal conspiracy”):

15

“What is a significant conspiracy theory that you find credible and compelling? Could
you please describe this theory and share why it resonates with you?”
They then were asked to elaborate on the next page:

20

25

“On the previous question, you wrote [RESPONSE]. Can you describe in detail the
specific evidence or events that initially led you to believe in this conspiracy theory?
How do you interpret this evidence in relation to commonly accepted explanations for the
same events?”
This information was fed forward to an instance of GPT-4 Turbo, which was tasked with
summarizing the conspiratorial belief into a single sentence (see Table S4 for the exact wording
of this API query). Participants were then asked to rate their belief in the summarized
conspiracy’s veracity (“Please indicate your level of confidence that this statement is true”)
using a scale that ranged from 0 (“Definitely False”) to 25 (“Probably False”) to 50
(“Uncertain”) to 75 (“Probably True”) to 100 (“Definitely True”).

45

Human-AI dialogues. Following these pre-treatment measures, participants were informed they
would be conversing with an advanced AI. To facilitate this real-time interaction within the
Qualtrics survey platform, we used JavaScript to call OpenAI’s Chat Completions API,
dynamically inject participant-specific information into the model’s instructions, and display the
model’s responses. Several details of this approach are worth mentioning. First, we used the
latest available GPT-4 model, which was gpt-4-1106-preview for Study 1 and gpt-4-0125preview for Study 2. Second, conversations were formatted to begin with a system message,
followed by alternating user and AI messages. The system message, in our case, included details
about the context, the goal of refuting a conspiracy belief, and instructions for how the model
should behave (all of which were invariant across each model call), as well as the participant’s
specific conspiracy theory, the participant’s stated reasons for believing that theory, and the
participant’s level of belief in the conspiracy (which varied across participants). Otherwise, our
model instructions were simple and did not involve hidden reasoning steps (e.g., chain-ofthought) or access to external tools (e.g., internet browsing) beyond those provided by default.
To facilitate a continuous conversation, for rounds 2 and 3 the previous AI- and human17

5

45

messages were included in the prompt as conversation histories. Third, no token limit was placed
on the AI’s responses, which frequently comprised hundreds of words (Figure S3), multiple
paragraphs, and markdown formatting (e.g., lists and section headings). Thus, although each
dialogue only lasted 3 rounds, the dialogues (a) represented 8.4 minutes of AI-human
engagement on average and (b) were information-dense, yet comparatively easy to read and
parse. Fourth, the AI’s messages were sent to participants after the full response was constructed
(rather than streamed word by word), necessitating idle time between each round of dialogue
during which a loading screen was shown.
In the treatment condition, the AI was instructed to argue persuasively against the participant’s
conspiracy theory. In the control conditions, the AI was instructed to either (a) discuss the
American medical system, (b) debate with participants about whether they prefer dogs or cats, or
(c) discuss participants’ past experiences with firefighters. We used a 60/40 split when
randomizing participants into the treatment or control conditions, and participants assigned to the
control were further randomized to one of the three control conditions, such that roughly 13-14%
of the sample was assigned to each control condition. No significant differences were identified
across the control groups, so we pooled them for all subsequent analyses.
Post-treatment measures. Following the conversations, participants re-rated their belief in the
focal conspiracy and then again completed the modified BCTI (α = .92). Given that, in many
cases, participants’ focal conspiracies resembled at least one item on the BCTI (the items were
chosen to reflect the most popular conspiracy theories), we computed three versions of pre- and
post-treatment BCTI scores. The first version was the mean response on all 15 BCTI items,
which we used to identify participants with a highly conspiratorial worldview. In the second
version, we dropped items that matched the participants’ focal conspiracy theory. Overlap was
identified using an instance of GPT-4 that was supplied with each participant’s conspiracy and
each BCTI item and queried concerning which of the BCTI items reflected an affirmative belief
in the participant’s conspiracy using a binary judgement (see SI section 7), yielding overlapadjusted BCTI scores for pre-treatment (α = .90) and post-treatment (α = .92). Thirdly, we
further filtered the BCTI item pool by retaining non-overlapping items that participants initially
rated above 50% (more belief than “uncertain”), which allowed for pre-treatment (α = .90) and
post-treatment (α = .90) overlap-adjusted BCTI scores for conspiracy theories that each
participant actively endorsed. We also administered the three true conspiracy items.
Recontacting at 10-days and 2-months. The participants from Study 1 were recontacted twice.
The first recontact occurred 10 days after completing the intervention (T3; n = 631, dropout rate
= 15.7% and 15.6% for the treatment and control groups, respectively). Participants in the
treatment condition who completed the T3 follow-up did not significantly differ from those who
did not return for either pre-treatment belief in their chosen conspiracy (t[454] = 0.61, p = .544)
or on the pre-treatment BCTI (t[454] = -0.71, p = .475). Participants completed the same
dependent variables as in Study 1 (i.e., endorsement of their chosen conspiracy theory and the
BCTI). The second recontact occurred 2 months (T4) after completing the intervention (n = 529,
dropout rate = 32.1% and 31.1% for the treatment and control groups, respectively). As with T3,
participants in the treatment who remained did not differ from those who dropped for either pretreatment belief in their chosen conspiracy (t[450] = 0.02, p = .977) or on the pre-treatment
BCTI (t[450] = -1.33, p = .183).
Study 2
18

5

For Study 2, two additional samples (Study 2a and 2b) were fielded from CloudConnect to
corroborate, replicate, and extend our experimental findings. Although the majority of materials
were identical across Studies 2a and 2b, we describe them separately because (a) we preregistered separate rounds of data collection, (b) we used different phrasings for the behavioral
outcome items, and (c) the data were collected several weeks apart. Particularly, we collected
Study 2b due to imprecise wording used in certain behavioral outcome items in Study 2a, as
noted below. In the main text, results are pooled across Studies 2a and 2b, except for those
pertaining to the behavioral outcomes that were modified between 2a and 2b.

10

Participants

15

20

In Study 2a, we preregistered a target sample of 1,000 complete responses from
CloudResearch’s Connect participant pool, using quota-based sampling for age, race, ethnicity,
and gender. A total of 1,427 individuals entered the survey, of whom 312 were redirected for
using a cell phone, 30 failed the initial pre-treatment writing screener, 14 failed an attention
check, and 104 discontinued prior to treatment, leaving 968. Of these participants, 218 did not
provide a genuine conspiracy theory and 81 endorsed their conspiracy statement at below 50%
certainty – such that the final sample analyzed sample size was n = 668. Similarly, in Study 2b,
we recruited 1545 demographically representative participants using the Connect pool, of whom
27 were redirected for using a cell phone, 30 failed the writing screen, 27 failed an attention
check, and 152 discontinued prior to treatment, leaving 1309. Of these participants, 296 did not
provide a genuine conspiracy theory and another 128 did not endorse their conspiracy above
50%, leaving a treatment sample of 885.

25

30

Thus, the full sample size across both rounds of Study 2 was n = 1553 (mean age = 41.9, mean
ideology = 3.09), which included 670 males, 724 females, and 13 participants who selected
another gender option (see Figure S4 and Table S3). These studies were run on 25-28 February
and 4-9 March 2024 and took 24.4 and 27.85 minutes on average to complete. The overall
attrition rate was 3.7%. Using a logistic regression model predicting whether or not a person
attrited, we find no evidence of differential rates of attrition in treatment vs. control (b = .02, p =
.97).
Procedure

35

40

Pre-treatment measures. For all open-ended responses, including those in the Human-AI
dialogues, the “paste” functionality was disabled to prevent automated responding. As in Study
1, participants began the experiment by answering a simple, writing-intensive question designed
to gauge their willingness and ability to take part in a written conversation. Those whose
responses were determined by GPT-4 Turbo to be low-effort or incoherent were redirected from
the survey. Subsequently, participants completed self-report items about their artificial
intelligence attitudes and demographic characteristics (mirroring those from Study 1). We did
not administer the Belief in Conspiracy Theories Index in Study 2, and instead proceeded
directly to the person-specific conspiracy assessment.

45

The wording of the person-specific instructions were modified slightly from Study 1 to (a)
explicitly define the theories to be described and (b) only indirectly classify the theories as
“conspiracies”. The first question’s wording was:
19

5

10

15

20

25

30

35

40

45

“Throughout history, various theories have emerged that suggest certain significant
events or situations are the result of secret plans by individuals or groups. These theories
often offer alternative explanations for events than those that are widely accepted by the
public or presented by official sources. Some people call these ‘conspiracy theories’.
Reflecting on this, are there any specific such theories that you find particularly credible
or compelling? Please describe one below and share your reasons for finding it
compelling.”
And the follow-up question, presented on a separate page:
“On the previous question, you wrote: "[conspiracy]". Could you share more about what
led you to find this theory compelling? For instance, are there specific pieces of evidence,
events, sources of information, or personal experiences that have particularly influenced
your perspective? Please describe these in as much detail as you feel comfortable.”
As in Study 1, this information was fed forward to an instance of GPT-4 Turbo, which was
tasked with summarizing the conspiratorial belief into a single sentence. Participants then
provided a rating reflecting their confidence in the summarized statement’s truth. The vast
majority (90.6%) reported that the AI model accurately summarized their perspective;
participants who received inaccurate summaries were excluded from subsequent analysis (note
that this is a pre-treatment exclusion). Before proceeding to the treatment, participants reported
how important the conspiracy was to them (“How important is this theory to your personal
beliefs or understanding of the world?”) on a scale from 0 (“Not all all important to my beliefs
and worldview”) to 8 (“Extremely important to my beliefs and worldview”).
Post-treatment measures. Following the conversations, participants re-rated the focal
conspiracy’s veracity and then completed a set of measures related to conspiracy-relevant
behavior and trust. In both studies, we assessed (a) intentions to ignore or unfollow social media
accounts espousing the focal conspiracy and (b) willingness to ignore or argue against people
who believe the focal conspiracy; in our analyses of these items, we pool data across Studies 2a
and 2b. Study 2a also asked about (c) willingness to engage in collective actions opposing the
focal conspiracy, and (d) intentions to join protests related to the focal conspiracy theory. After
data collection, however, we noticed problems in the wording of these items that made them
uninterpretable, and thus we do not analyze these items. Item c, concerning collective actions,
was both counter-directionally worded (relative to the other items) and used a response scale
containing negative and positive options that was not counter-directionally worded, potentially
resulting in a confused pattern of results. Item d, reflecting protest intentions, did not specify
whether the protests supported or opposed the focal conspiracy, making responses to that item
uninterpretable. In Study 2b, we attempted to rectify these issues by dropping item c and
changing the wording of item d to remove the ambiguity (i.e., “If people you knew were going to
engage in a protest or action in support of the theory you described, how likely would you be to
join in?”), as well as visually highlighting words indicating item directionality and having
response-option direction randomized between participants and standardized within participants.
Finally, in Study 2b we asked GPT-4 Turbo to generate petitions opposing the participants’ focal
conspiracy theory, which we then asked participants if they wanted to sign. Unfortunately,
20

5

10

inspecting these petitions indicated that many of them were not actually in opposition to the
focal conspiracy theory (e.g. for a participant who thought the government was concealing the
existence of aliens, GPT-4 Turbo asked if they wanted to sign a petition calling for greater
government transparency about aliens – which plays into the conspiracy theory, rather than
opposing it). To determine how serious of a problem this was, we conducted a post hoc analysis
in which 670 crowd workers each rated a random subset of 3 petitions as either “opposing” or
“not opposing” its corresponding conspiracy theory after completing a brief training exercise. Of
the 404 petitions rated at least twice, only 199 (49.3%) were rated as actually opposing the focal
conspiracy in more than half of responses; and only 118 (29.2%) were unanimously rated as
opposing the conspiracy. This makes participants’ choice of whether to sign the petition not
useful for determining the effect of the intervention, and thus we do not include analysis of it.
In both Study 2a and 2b, participants then completed measures of general trust (1-item), personal
trust (1-item), and institutional trust (5-items), which were adapted from the OECD Guidelines
on Measuring Trust (75).

1. Conspiracy Theory Identification Using Natural Language Processing
In all studies, we used LLMs to filter participants who did not supply a genuine conspiracy
theory. Specifically, we used GPT-4 Turbo to evaluate each participant’s free-response
conspiracy statement using three prompts, which are provided in Table S4 (model temperature =
0).
Prompt 1 was applied to both participants’ raw, open-ended text responses describing their focal
conspiracy and, in a separate model call, to the GPT-summarized conspiracy statements. Prompt
2, which was intended to determine whether the statement contained a conspiracy theory
(ignoring whether the statement described belief in a conspiracy), was applied only to the GPTsummarized conspiracy statements. Prompt 3, which was intended to identify cases where
participants described a conspiracy theory but also expressed skepticism, was applied only to the
raw responses. To evaluate the reliability of the ratings provided across different prompts, we
used Gwet’s AC1 coefficient. The percent agreement across raters was .86, reflecting an AC1 =
.77 (95% CI [.76, .79]), with 60.2% of statements classified as a conspiracy theory under all four
prompts (69.3% in Sample 1 and 55.3% in Sample 2; see Tables S5-S6). To adjudicate between
the prompts, the first author coded a random subset of 200 theories, which revealed a stronger
agreement with Prompt 1 (AC1 = .80 [.72, .89]) than Prompt 2 (AC1 = .71 [.62, .82]) or Prompt
3 (AC1 = .56 [.44, .67]). Hence, we proceeded with Prompt 1 in our primary analyses.
2. Estimating the Treatment Effect on Focal and Non-focal Conspiracy Beliefs
We fitted a linear regression with the Lin (76) covariate adjustment and HC2 standard errors to
test the overarching impact of the intervention (treatment condition vs. control conditions) on
conspiracy beliefs. That is, to obtain the direct effect of condition, we included pre-treatment
belief in the conspiracy theory as a covariate (i.e., linear regression with one covariate and the
condition dummy). We report the untransformed beta estimate, 95% confidence interval, and pvalue (Table S7-S8). Further, we report dppc2 (77), an effect size estimate that uses the pooled
pretest standard deviation for weighting the differences of the pre-post means. This analysis was
repeated for belief in the focal conspiracy, and average belief across all non-focal conspiracies
from the BCTI.
To evaluate the durability of the treatment at follow-up, we specified a linear mixed model
(estimated using REML) to predict conspiracy belief (one observation per user-time point) with
experimental condition and time point (formula: ConspiracyBelief ~ Treatment [vs. Control] *
TimePoint; Table S9-S11). The model included random intercepts on participant. Durability over
time was assessed within the treatment condition via pairwise comparisons between (a) Time 1
(pre-treatment) and each post-treatment timepoint and (b) Time 2 (immediately following
treatment) and Times 3 and 4 (10-days and 2-months). However, we also evaluated differences
26

between the treatment and control groups at each timepoint to account for regression to the
mean.
2.1 The treatment effect persists when focal conspiracy beliefs are measured prior to the openended conspiracy question
Soliciting open-ended descriptions and explanations of people’s thinking processes may
introduce error into subsequent measures of those thoughts (78). To provide a treatment effect
estimate free from this potential source of bias, we identified cases where participants’ focal
conspiracy matched the content of a BCTI item in Sample 1 (n = 303). Because the BCTI was
administered before our solicitation of the focal conspiracy, any post-treatment change in
endorsement of the matching BCTI item would suggest that our conspiracy belief solicitation did
not systematically bias our conclusions. In such cases, the treatment had a substantial effect on
post-treatment conspiracy endorsement relative to the control (b = -12.04, 95% CI [-16.63, 7.46], p < .001, d = .70)
2.2 The treatment effect is larger under more conservative definitions of a conspiracy theory
We replicate our findings using only the statements classified as conspiracies by all four GPT-4
prompts (and which met our other inclusion criteria; n = 1696). Effect sizes were larger under
this more conservative analysis. In Sample 1, the treatment reduced participants’ belief in their
conspiracy theory participants’ stated conspiracy by 17.2 units more than the control (95% CI
[14.4, 19.9], p < .001, d = 1.22), which translates into a 22.42% decrease in belief among those
in treatment (vs. 1.09% in the control). Participants in the treatment in Study 2 reduced belief in
their focal conspiracy by 13.9 units more than participants in the control (95% CI [11.9, 15.9], p
< .001, d = 0.91), translating into a 20.00% decrease in belief (versus a 2.42% decrease in the
control).
2.3 The treatment may be specific to false conspiracies.
To evaluate the impact of the intervention on true conspiracy theories, we took a two-pronged
approach. First, in Study 2, we identified participants who provided conspiracy statements that
were highly plausible (vs. implausible) using GPT-4 Turbo. Only 1.2% of participants provided a
conspiracy that the AI designated as “highly plausible” on a 5-point scale (i.e., 1 out of 5).
Qualitative examination of these plausible conspiracy statements indicated that all of them
concerned conspiracies that had, indeed, occurred (e.g., MK Ultra, the Gulf of Tonkin incident,
ECHELON). For these participants, the treatment non-significantly increased conspiracy belief
(b = 6.51, 95% CI [-39.42, 52.45], p = .76, d = .43), and this treatment effect was significantly
different from the effect on the other conspiracies (bΔTrue - False Consiracies = -20.57, 95% CI [-33.14,
-8.00], p = .001). Conspiracy theories rated 2 of 5 on the implausibility scale (5.9%), which
comprised a mixture of true statements and innocuous conspiracies, also yielded a nonsignificant treatment effect (b = -5.47, 95% CI [-14.44, 3.60], p = .23, d = .42). By contrast, the
most implausible conspiracy theories (30.3%) yielded a treatment effect of b = -16.28, 95% CI [21.15, -11.41], p < .001, d = 1.09), resulting in the disordinal interaction shown in Figure S5.

27

In addition, we made use of the 3 true conspiracy statements administered as part of BCTI scale
in Sample 1 to evaluate the specificity of the intervention’s spillover effect to true vs. false
conspiracy statements. Particularly, we computed variables reflecting participants’ discernment
between true and false BCTI items (true endorsement - false endorsement) and estimated a linear
model predicting post-treatment discernment with experimental condition and pre-treatment
discernment. Although the effect of the AI dialogues on discernment was not statistically
significant (p = .056) it was in the expected direction, such that discernment was directionally
greater in the treatment condition compared to the control (b = 1.46, 95% CI [-.04, 2.95]; see
Figure S6). The lack of significance for spillover discernment may be due to having elicited
belief in the true conspiracies within a single block consisting mostly of false conspiracies,
which can reduce variance in responses across items (79).
3. Differentiating Between Conspiracy Theories Using Text Embeddings and Cluster Analyses
To ensure that the text embeddings reflected primarily the substantive content of each conspiracy
theory rather than each participant's verbal abilities and linguistic preferences, we relied on the
GPT-4 Turbo summarizations of each open-ended response (rather than the raw text entered by
the participant). After stemming the words and removing English stopwords and punctuation, we
used the text-embedding-3-large model–one of the best-performing models available to the
public–to generate text embeddings (numerical representations of text and concepts that capture
their underlying semantic and syntactic structure) (80). We then used cluster analytic algorithms
to sort the embeddings. The text embeddings were first subjected to PCA. Enough components
were retained to capture 85% of the total variance in the data (k = 352). This threshold was
chosen to maintain a balance between reducing dimensionality and preserving the data's inherent
structure. We next applied the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise
(DBSCAN) algorithm to a cosine distance matrix of the reduced embeddings (81, 82). DBSCAN
was selected because of its ability to identify clusters of arbitrary shape and its robustness to
outliers, making it suitable for text data which often contains noise and irregular cluster patterns.
Further, density-based clustering accounts for “noise” (i.e., some points are not assigned a cluster
label). We used an ε value of 3 (i.e., the distance parameter that defines the radius around a data
point to search for neighboring points) and specified the minimum number of points required to
form a single cluster as 15, considering border points. This approach identified 14 distinct
clusters and labeled 594 points as noise (representing conspiracy theories that do not fit well into
any cluster). The clustering result shows a diverse distribution of points across clusters, with the
largest cluster (JFK conspiracies) containing 310 points and the smallest (government
surveillance conspiracies) containing 15 points. The noise points constitute a significant portion
of the dataset (29%), underscoring the variability of conspiracy theories in this population.
Given that the intention of this analysis was to identify coherent, interpretable cleavages in the
universe of potential conspiracy theories – rather than identify the genuine structure of
conspiracy theories in the population – we primarily evaluated the clustering results based on
substantive similarities in the conspiracy statements belonging to each cluster. Qualitatively
examining the conspiracies assigned to each cluster revealed readily apparent similarities across
virtually all statements in each cluster, leading us to retain the 14-cluster DBSCAN solution.
Representative statements from each cluster, as well as a brief GPT-4 summary of all statements
comprising each cluster, are provided in Table S12.
28

To test whether the identified clusters moderate the AI-driven treatment, we integrated cluster
membership (including noise points as a distinct cluster) as a categorical variable into our
treatment effect model (formula: [Post-treatment conspiracy belief] ~ [Experimental condition] *
[DBSCAN cluster] + [Pre-teatment conspiracy belief]) and tested the significance of the relative
improvement in fit attributable to the interactions between experimental condition and each
cluster using an analysis of variance. Clusters with < 1% membership were removed from this
analysis to increase statistical power. To test the statistical significance of the treatment for
members of each cluster, we used pairwise comparisons (for differences between the treatment
vs. control conditions of each cluster). The model is reported in Table S13 and Figure 1C.
3.1 Robustness checks for DBSCAN results
We repeated this analysis using varying ε parameters, as well as by narrowing the analysis to
include only statements that all prompts agreed were conspiracy theories (see 3.1.2). ε
parameters outside of 2 and 3.9 yielded binary clustering solutions, while clustering solutions
that classified < 50% of statements into a single cluster (including noise) had ε between 3.0 and
3.6. To provide more a more fine-grained clustering result than that in the main text, we present
the solution for ε = 3.0 in Figure S7. Results for the narrower pool of conspiracy theories are
shown in Figure S8.
4. Individual Difference Moderators
To investigate the effect of individual differences on the treatment effect, particularly among
participants with deeply rooted beliefs, we used a combination of generalized additive models
(GAMs), multiple linear regression models, and post-hoc causal forests.
4.1 Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
The use of GAMs was specifically aimed at uncovering sharp reductions in treatment efficacy
among committed conspiracy believers via non-linear interactions, so we focused on pretreatment focal and non-focal conspiracy beliefs, as well as the perceived importance of the focal
conspiracy. Each GAM analysis began with a base model where post-treatment belief was
predicted using the experimental condition factor, a smooth term for pre-treatment specific
beliefs (to mirror the covariate-adjustment used in the main effect model), and a smooth term for
the relevant moderator. We then specified an interaction GAM, which incorporated a term that
allowed the smooth effect of the relevant moderator to vary by experimental condition. All
GAMs were fitted with the REML smoothing parameter. Comparative analyses between the base
and interaction models were based on an analysis of deviance (via the gam::anova.gam function),
though we also report AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) values and R². Model results are
reported in Tables S14 – S16.
4.2 Multiple linear regression models
To further understand individual differences that best explained variation in treatment effects, a
large multiple linear regression model was employed. The primary model, pooling across
29

participants from all studies, included linear interactions between the experimental condition and
all key predictors shared across samples: pre-treatment specific beliefs, familiarity with
generative AI, usage and trust in generative AI, religiosity, partisanship, extremism, age, type of
conspiracy belief, education level, race, and gender. We also specified additional, samplespecific regressions that included intellectual humility and actively open-minded thinking (in
Study 1) and personal, general, and institutional trust (in Study 2). We estimated these models
using OLS with HC2 robust standard errors. Results are presented in Tables S17 - S18.
4.3 Causal forests
Finally, we deployed causal forests, a machine learning technique for heterogeneous treatment
effect estimation, with the grf package in R. Causal forest models were trained based on: (a) the
full, combined sample, using only covariates shared across sample, (b) Study 1, using all
covariates available, and (b) Study 2, using all covariates available. The causal forests were
trained with 100,000 trees and all tunable parameters tuned by cross-validation. We used the grf
package’s summary function, test_calibration, to assess the forests’ goodness of fit on held-out
data. Variable importance scores are reported to highlight which moderators were most
influential in affecting treatment outcomes. Estimates derived from the causal forest model
representing the expected effect of the treatment for each individual (i.e., the conditional average
treatment effect; CATE) are reported as a function of various moderators (i.e., those with high
importance or particular relevance to conspiracy beliefs). Full results of the causal forest analysis
are provided in the RMarkdown document accompanying this manuscript.
5. Estimating Treatment Effects for Behavioral Indicators
To evaluate the impact of the treatment on behavioral indicators, we used OLS with HC2 robust
standard errors (i.e., formula: DV ~ ExperimentalCondition). Given that the behavioral outcome
variables are on differing Likert-type scales, we report standardized beta coefficients with 95%
confidence intervals to facilitate comparisons across the DVs (Tables S19 – S21). Ordinal
regression models, which yielded identical results, are provided in the RMarkdown document
accompanying this manuscript.
6. What Occurred During the Conversations?
We shed light on how the AI went about persuading conspiracy theorists, via post hoc natural
language processing analyses of the conversations (we pooled data across studies to maximize
power. We first had the model list the strategies it would use in the setting of our experiment,
and then had it go through each conversation and indicate the extent to which strategy(s) were
used in that conversation (83). Strikingly, reasoning-based strategies were clearly the most
frequently used approach (see Figure S1): evidence-based alternative perspectives were used
“extensively” in a large majority of conversations (83%) and encouraging critical thinking was
either used “extensively” or used “moderately” in virtually all conversations (99%). Conversely,
the rapport-building strategies of finding common ground and expressing understanding were
used only “moderately” in most conversations, and other strategies (including various
psychological and social/emotional strategies) were used even less. These descriptive results
30

suggest that the AI was largely being persuasive due to actual use of evidence and arguments to
change people’s minds. Results are presented separately by round of conversation in Figures S9S13, and the length of AI and participant responses are shown in Figure S3.
However, whether and to what extent LLMs are capable of detecting the presence and ubiquity
of these persuasive strategies from raw text remains unknown. We did not systematically
validate the AI model’s text-annotation accuracy (e.g., via trained raters), but previous validation
studies of less sophisticated GPT models on similar tasks indicate performance around or above
that of human crowdworkers (83, 83–87), including for detecting intellectual humility (88).
Having closely inspected a small sample of conversations, and finding no obvious errors or clear
mistakes, we proceeded with reporting the descriptive results. Nonetheless, we caution readers
that these findings are untested and may lack validity.
6.1 Classifying the AI Model’s Persuasion Strategies
To describe the persuasion strategies used by the AI model during the dialogues, we used GPT-4
Turbo to both generate candidate strategies (based on 10 API queries) and, in a separate set of
API queries, to detect the presence and ubiquity of each candidate strategy in the dialogues.
Particularly, we used the following prompt to identify plausible strategies:
“If you, GPT-4-turbo, were tasked with convincing a human being to stop believing in a
specific conspiracy during an extended conversation (where you had been provided
information about the human's particular conspiracy beliefs), which persuasive strategies
would you use?”
Given a model temperature of 1, the AI model returned similar but non-overlapping sets of
strategies in each query.
We next used GPT-4 Turbo to detect the presence of each strategy and the frequency with which
they were used by the AI during each conversation. We instructed the AI to identify the 10
strategies mentioned in at least half of the previous model queries. The LLM was provided with
a labeled transcript of each conversation and queried with the following prompt (model
temperature = 0):
“You are about to be shown the text of a written conversation about conspiracy theories.
The two people in this conversation are a Debunker and a Believer. It is the role of the
Debunker to convince the Believer that the Believer is wrong to hold a particular
conspiracy theory. Each conversation will have 3 rounds.
Your job is to process the conversation and return a classification of the nature of each of
the DEBUNKER’S responses. Particularly, you will determine whether the debunker’s
responses use each of the following persuasion strategies.
** Strategy List **

31

Build Rapport: Establish a respectful and understanding relationship with the Believer
(e.g., to ensure the conversation is seen as a friendly exchange rather than a confrontation;
demonstrating understanding and empathy towards the individuals beliefs without
judgment).
Critical Thinking: Encourage the Believer to question and analyze the logic, evidence, and
sources behind their beliefs, promoting a more analytical and reflective approach to
information.
Alternative Explanations: Provide plausible, evidence-based alternative perspectives or
explanations for events or phenomena that are attributed to conspiracy theories.
Harm: Discuss the personal or societal harms of the conspiracy beliefs.
Stories/Examples: Share stories, anecdotes, or real-world examples.
Encourage Empathy: Help the Believer consider the impact of conspiracy beliefs on others,
fostering empathy and a broader perspective.
Socratic Questioning: Employ a questioning approach that leads the Believer to reflect on
and examine the validity of their beliefs.
Conflicting Evidence: Introduce facts or data that directly contradict claims made by the
conspiracy theory or the Believer.
Common Ground/Shared Reality: Identify and build on beliefs or values that the Debunker
shares with the Believer.
Psychological Needs: Recognize and address the emotional aspects or psychological needs
that may be underlying the Believers attraction to conspiracy theories, such as a desire for
control or understanding.
Inconsistencies/Logical Fallacies: Identify and discuss logical inconsistencies or fallacies
in the conspiracy theorys arguments.
Please be sure not to classify the responses of the Believer. Use the Believers responses
only for context, so that you can understand the responses of the Debunker.
As the conversation follows 3 rounds, you should provide a rating for each strategy’s
presence in each round (i.e., 3 ratings per strategy).
Please format your ratings as JSON.
** Response Scale **
Use the following response scale for each rating:
32

None: Strategy not used.
Low: Strategy used rarely, in a limited fashion.
Moderate: Strategy used repeatedly or with clear emphasis.
High: Strategy used extensively and/or centrally throughout the response.”
Thus, GPT-4 evaluated each strategy's prevalence in each conversational round. We depict
strategies used in conversational round 1 in Figure 5 and strategy data for all rounds in Figures
S8 – S12.
7. Accounting for Overlap between the BCTI Items and Focal Conspiracies
We defined a function that takes each participant’s statement of conspiracy belief as input and
determines whether it reflects an affirmative belief in any of 15 BCTI items (which are also
statements of conspiracy theories) by sending the conspiracy theory text and a list of the 15
conspiracy theories to GPT-4 Turbo and getting a response in the form of a string of 15 0s and 1s
(where 1 indicates an affirmative belief in that particular conspiracy theory). We then calculated
average scores for each participant’s non-overlapping BCTI items. The number of overlapping
conspiracy theories ranged from 0 - 3 (M = .71). The GPT-4 prompt was as follows:
“Determine if the presented text reflects an affirmative belief in any of the following 15
conspiracy theories:
Conspiracy 1: A powerful and secretive group, known as the New World Order, are
planning to eventually rule the world through an autonomous world government, which
would replace sovereign governments.
Conspiracy 2: COVID-19 was produced under laboratory conditions by the Chinese
government.
Conspiracy 3: The US government had foreknowledge about the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor, but allowed the attack to take place so as to be able to enter the Second World
War.
Conspiracy 4: US agencies intentionally created the AIDS epidemic and administered it
to Black and gay men in the 1970s.
Conspiracy 5: The assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., was the result of an organised
conspiracy by US government agencies such as the CIA and FBI.
Conspiracy 6: The Apollo moon landings never happened and were staged in a
Hollywood film studio.
Conspiracy 7: Area 51 in Nevada, US, is a secretive military base that contains hidden
alien spacecraft and/or alien bodies.
Conspiracy 8: The US government allowed the 9/11 attacks to take place so that it would
have an excuse to achieve foreign (e.g., wars in Afghanistan and Iraq) and domestic (e.g.,
attacks on civil liberties) goals that had been determined prior to the attacks.
Conspiracy 9: The assassination of John F. Kennedy was not committed by the lone
gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald, but was rather a detailed, organised conspiracy to kill the
President.
33

Conspiracy 10: In July 1947, the US military recovered the wreckage of an alien craft
from Roswell, New Mexico, and covered up the fact.
Conspiracy 11: Princess Diana’s death was not an accident, but rather an organised
assassination by members of the British royal family who disliked her.
Conspiracy 12: The Oklahoma City bombers, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, did
not act alone, but rather received assistance from neo-Nazi groups.
Conspiracy 13: The Coca Cola company intentionally changed to an inferior formula
with the intent of driving up demand for their classic product, later reintroducing it for
their financial gain.
Conspiracy 14: Special interest groups are suppressing, or have suppressed in the past,
technologies that could provide energy at reduced cost or reduced pollution output.
Conspiracy 15: Government agencies in the UK are involved in the distribution of illegal
drugs to ethnic minorities.
Format your answer as a list of EXACTLY 15 0s or 1s. Do not use spaces or commas in
your answer. For example, 101000000000001 would be an acceptable response”
8. Additional Experimental Data from Lucid
We repeated the procedures of Study 2 using a sample recruited via Lucid Marketplace, which
provides samples quota-matched to the national distribution on age, gender, ethnicity, and
geographic region that, relative to samples recruited from Cloud Connect, are (1) more faithful
reflections of the US population, (2) subject to greater data quality issues, and (3) comprise a
lower proportion of “professional” study participants (i.e., those with many past experiences
taking academic surveys) (77). Reflecting the inattention rates characteristic of Lucid samples,
only 211 / 901 participants who entered the survey passed our attention screeners and began the
intervention. Of these participants, 49% did not provide a genuine conspiracy theory and another
4% did not endorse their (genuine) conspiracy above the scale midpoint, leaving a treatment
sample of 101. All participants received the treatment (there was no control). To test the
treatment effect, we fitted a linear mixed model to predict conspiracy belief with time point
(formula: ConspiracyBelief ~ TimePoint [Pre vs. Post Treatment). The model included random
intercepts on participant. The model's intercept, corresponding to Time = Before Conversation,
was at 87.78 (95% CI [83.49, 92.07], p < .001). Within this model, the effect of Time [After
Conversation] was statistically significant and negative (b = -10.99, 95% CI [-16.09, -5.88], p <
.001, dAV = .53; Figure S14). The effect remained significant among the 57 participants with pretreatment beliefs >= 90% (b = -12.25, 95% CI [-19.14, -5.35], p < .001, dAV = .80) and, while not
statistically significant due to sample size, the point estimate for the 37 participants who reported
the conspiracy being highly important to their worldview (b = -6.53, 95% CI [-13.83, 0.77], p =
0.079, dAV = .42) was extremely similar to the magnitude found in our main experiments. As
reported in the Discussion, we also administered a pre- and post-treatment measure of trust in AI
(using the same measure as for studies 1 and 2). Notably, the treatment significantly increased
participants’ trust in AI (in a linear mixed model to predict AI trust with time point: b = .80, 95%
CI [0.51, 1.09], p < .001, dAV = .45; Figure S15).

were capable of reading
and writing in English,
and were willing to
answer the sort of openended questions on
which the intervention
relies.

"Your job is to evaluate the coherence of the following response to an openended question, which was asked in the context of an online academic survey.
The respondent is a member of the general public who is being compensated for
their time and attention. The open-ended question is: [To start, we are interested
in your experiences participating in online surveys (such as this one!). Why are
you taking this survey? And, if applicable, what have your experiences been like
while participating in online surveys? Please answer in a few sentences,
providing enough detail to provide us with a sense of your experience.]

Conspiracy
Summarization

Provide a standardized
statement of each
participants conspiracy
belief to be converted
into the pre- and posttreatment measure of
focal conspiracy
beliefs.

"Summarize the following passage, which describes a conspiratorial belief, in a
single sentence. Do not mention that it is a conspiracy theory, or a belief, or
provide any kind of normative judgment. Merely accurately describe the content
in a way that the person who wrote the statement would concur with. Frame it as
an assertion. If the statement is already short, no need to change it very much. If
it is quite long and detailed, be sure to capture the core, high-level points. Do not
focus on the evidence provided for the belief -- merely focus on the basic

Prompt
1

“Determine if the following text contains or reflects a statement that, if endorsed, would indicate affirmative belief
in a conspiracy theory (or something quite like a conspiracy theory). Respond only either “Conspiracy theory” or
“Not conspiracy theory”.

Prompt
2

“Your task is to determine whether a given statement describes a conspiracy theory or not. A conspiracy theory is
an explanation for an event or situation that invokes a conspiracy by powerful people or organizations, often
without credible evidence. Conspiracy theories often involve claims of secret plots, coverups, or the manipulation
of information by influential groups.
Here are some examples of conspiracy theories:
1. "The moon landing was faked by the U.S. government to win the space race."
2. "The COVID-19 pandemic was planned and orchestrated by pharmaceutical companies to profit from vaccine
sales."
3. "Climate change is a hoax perpetrated by scientists and politicians to gain funding and control the population."
And here are some examples of statements that are not conspiracy theories:
4. "The Watergate scandal involved a cover-up of illegal activities by the Nixon administration."
5. "The tobacco industry concealed the harmful effects of smoking for many years."
6. "Corporate lobbying influences political decisions in favor of special interests."
For each statement provided, respond with either "Conspiracy theory" or "Not conspiracy theory".

Prompt
3

“Analyze the following statement using a chain-of-thought approach to determine if it describes a conspiracy
theory that the author believes in. Look for indicators such as personal endorsement, certainty in language, and
elements that typically characterize conspiracy theories. Briefly note your observations.
Present your conclusions in the following JSON format:

I believe there was a plot to kill former President John
F. Kennedy. Evidence points to the fact that there was
more than one gunshot fired. Possibly, there was
another shooter(s) that were involved to confuse
authorities during their investigations. It's possible
that former Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson knew
that plan and had a hit ordered on Kennedy. Johnson
wanted to be President and thought assassinating
Kennedy was the answer. I have read articles and
books that discuss this theory in length. I cannot
remember where I read the articles or which books.
There also have been television specials delving into
inconsistencies in the original investigation of
Kennedy's assassination.

Skepticism and conspiracy theories concerning the
official account of President Kennedy's assassination,
proposing various theories that suggest involvement by
government agencies like the CIA, multiple shooters,
and a broader conspiracy. Key themes include doubts
about Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone, the possibility
of a cover-up involving various powerful entities, and
the suggestion of motives tied to JFK's policies and
actions. These perspectives highlight a persistent belief
in a complex plot behind Kennedy's assassination,
challenging the lone gunman theory with arguments
about implausible bullet trajectories and
inconsistencies in evidence.

Aliens

14.0

12.1

That Area 51 could potentially be the site of alien
contact. It is compelling to me because I want to
know that we are not alone in the entire universe. It is
also compelling because of the extra advanced
technology that it would have taken to get here to
Earth. The Phoenix Lights are so convincing to me. I
feel like that was actually aliens. Also, the Roswell
incident and the LA UFO battle lead me to believe
that we might not be getting the entire truth that is out
there. I do not buy some of the explanations that these
are merely bad recordings.

The U.S. government, among others, is concealing
evidence of extraterrestrial life and UFOs, particularly
in relation to secretive sites like Area 51 and incidents
like the Roswell crash. Many assertions cite
declassified documents, whistleblower accounts, and
personal sightings as evidence of extraterrestrial visits
and government cover-ups, suggesting a significant
disconnect between public information and alleged
government knowledge on the matter. The statements
collectively highlight a deep-seated suspicion that there
is more to know about extraterrestrial existence and
human-alien interactions than is officially
acknowledged.

COVID-19

11.7

6.3

Covid-19 was man made and it was nothing but a
simulation for the global elites to see how much they
can control the masses I have seen videos of people
that work in the medical field warning the masses
about the global elites plan

A range of theories and beliefs concerning the origins
and nature of COVID-19 and the vaccine developed in
response. The assertions vary widely, from the virus
being a natural occurrence to it being a lab-made
bioweapon. Many statements suggest deliberate
manipulation or cover-up by various governments or
organizations, with some highlighting potential ulterior
motives such as population control or economic gain.
Concerns about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19
vaccines are prevalent, with numerous claims of
adverse effects and skepticism about the vaccines'
development and promotion.

9/11

7.1

5.8

9/11 was an inside job. Too many Americans
benefited/profited from it for it to be a coincidence or
some one-off attack. Ultimately it was a very
methodical and calculated maneuver that required
some degree of active participation or at least
complicity from American leaders. Whatever Alex
Jones said is probably what I found most compelling.

Various conspiracy theories regarding the September
11 attacks, suggesting that they were an inside job or
that the US government had foreknowledge and
allowed them to happen. The assertions point to
perceived inconsistencies in the official account, such
as the collapse of the Twin Towers and Building 7, the
attack on the Pentagon, and the flight path and
capabilities of the hijackers. Some theories suggest that
the attacks were orchestrated to justify the invasions of
Afghanistan and Iraq, to secure oil resources, or to
implement the Patriot Act and enhance surveillance.
Others hint at financial motives, citing insurance
policies and financial anomalies related to the World
Trade Center. The theories often reference controlled
demolition, prior intelligence warnings, and supposed
benefits to certain individuals or sectors, such as
defense contractors, as part of their argumentation.

Illuminati /
New World
Order

2.6

6.4

World leaders destroying all governments, businesses,
and capitalism in order to bring forth the New World
Order agenda. This resonates with me because this
isn't a conspiracy theory. It has always been a fact and
we are currently witnessing the communist style

A range of conspiracy theories suggesting that various
secretive groups or elite individuals exert significant,
often malevolent, control over global events,
economies, and governments. Theories include the
Illuminati's influence on celebrities and global events,

63

government, which is what will be used under the
New World Order, manifest right before our eyes.
Before the 20th century, there never existed in the
world a welfare state. Citizens are being taxed
heavily, can barely afford to eat, and can't afford to
buy a house. World leaders and so-called elites gather
around for various events yearly, who are un-elected,
dictating how civilians everywhere should live. Being
told repeatedly that you will own nothing and be
happy. Climate change is not about the environment,
it is about total control and world domination. These
are all communistic values!

the New World Order's alleged attempts to establish a
global government, and the control exerted by groups
like the Freemasons or Bilderberg. Other assertions
involve the manipulation of the music and
entertainment industries, political systems, and
economic structures by these secretive elites,
suggesting they shape societal norms and policies to
maintain their power and wealth. The statements often
reference perceived evidence, such as symbols,
policies, and the actions of high-profile individuals, to
support claims of a hidden agenda aimed at
manipulating public perception and global outcomes.

Malevolent
Corporations

6.6

3.3

I have heard that the cure to cancer, aids, and many
other illnesses have been discovered, but that the
government and large pharmaceutical corporations
are hiding the information/ have buried it because it
would put them out of business. I don't trust big
business and believe that corporations are greedy and
do not care about people, so I believe that this could
be true. We have so many medical and technological
advancements, and so many brilliant minds have been
studying these types of illnesses that it just seems
unlikely that we have not made any advancements
towards finding a real cure for these things.

These statements cover a range of conspiracy theories
and critical views on corporate practices. They suggest
that corporations engage in deceptive practices to
manipulate consumer behavior, suppress technological
advancements, and prioritize profits over public wellbeing. Theories include the manipulation of consumer
products, suppression of environmentally friendly
technologies, and unethical practices within the
healthcare, food, and energy industries. The statements
reflect a skepticism towards corporate motives,
suggesting that these entities have the power and
incentive to engage in activities that are not in the
public interest, often with a focus on maintaining
market dominance, driving consumption, or
suppressing competition.

Moon
Landing

3.8

4.9

I believe the moon landings were faked. It is quite
clear, when you look closely at the facts with a truly
open mind, that we did not (and still do not) have the
technology to transport humans into space any further
than earth's orbit. For example, the Van Allen
radiation belts would have killed any astronauts on
the way. The moon landings were filmed in a studio
to raise Americans' spirits after the Space Race. Only
a few people knew the truth and they were forbidden
from being honest about it for reasons of national
security. It has been many decades and no other
country has been able to land on the moon, even
though countries like China absolutely would have
the funds and motivation to do so in order to
showcase their own technology to the world.

This cluster of statements centers on the conspiracy
theory that the Apollo moon landings were fabricated.
These assertions highlight skepticism about the
authenticity of the moon landing, suggesting that it was
staged by the US government or NASA to win the
space race against the Soviet Union, enhance national
prestige, or for other geopolitical or propaganda
reasons. Key points of contention include alleged
inconsistencies in the lunar surface footage, such as the
behavior of the American flag, the absence of stars in
the sky, the quality of the photographic and video
evidence, and the technology available at the time.
Some claims suggest the involvement of filmmakers,
specifically Stanley Kubrick, in creating the moon
landing footage. Others point to the lack of subsequent
manned moon missions as further evidence of the
original landing's inauthenticity.

2020 Election
Fraud

4.0

4.7

The one that really sticks out is the conspiracy by the
deep state to steal the 2020 election from President
Trump. I do not believe that Biden won, and I think
the election was definitely stolen. Evidence of illegal
ballot harvesting, illegal ballot drop off boxes, dead
voters voting, improper signature verification, late
night ballot drops for Biden, illegal immigrants
voting, voting machine malfunctions, voting machine
switching votes for Trump to Biden, illegal (and fake)
mail in ballots, and voting after the polls closed are
some of the documented examples.

The 2020 U.S. presidential election was subject to
fraud and manipulation, particularly focusing on mailin ballots, vote counting irregularities, and the alleged
involvement of various domestic and foreign entities.
Many assertions suggest that these alleged irregularities
led to an illegitimate outcome favoring President Joe
Biden over President Donald Trump, with some
statements citing specific incidents and documentaries
as evidence. The cluster also includes perspectives on
foreign influence in U.S. elections and the perceived
alignment of certain politicians with foreign interests.

Jeffrey
Epstein

2.8

4.1

Jeff Epstein did not kill himself resonates with me.
The elite of the world needed to silence him, and it
will be coming out sooner than later all of the scum
who joined him in his pedo island. It's a conspiracy
there is no evidence. It just makes sense that
influential people would need him to be silenced.

The death of Jeffrey Epstein, suggesting that it was not
a suicide but rather a murder orchestrated to protect
powerful individuals connected to him. Many
comments highlight the irregularities and lapses in
prison security protocols at the time of his death, such
as malfunctioning cameras and guard negligence. The
theories suggest that Epstein had incriminating
information on influential figures, which could have
motivated his assassination to prevent the exposure of
their involvement in criminal activities. Some

64

statements also explore the idea that Epstein's death
was staged or that he might still be alive, leveraging his
connections to evade justice.
MLK

3.1

1.5

Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated by law
enforcement agencies under orders from political
leaders who viewed him as a threat to the status quo,
employing James Earl Ray as a scapegoat, to halt the
social and economic advancement of African
Americans.

A belief that U.S. government agencies, particularly the
FBI and CIA, were involved in the assassination of
Martin Luther King Jr., viewing him as a threat to the
status quo due to his civil rights activism and influence.
These theories often point to the government's
surveillance and discreditation efforts against King, the
use of James Earl Ray as a scapegoat, and a broader
pattern of government opposition to civil rights
movements and leaders. The statements reflect deep
skepticism toward the official narrative, indicating a
suspicion of a coordinated effort to silence King's push
for social change.

Princess
Diana

2.3

1.2

The conspiracy theory I find most compelling is that
Princess Diana was killed under the direction of the
royal family. One thing about conspiracy theories is
that they cannot involve too many people or else
someone is bound to slip. For this to work, not very
many people needed to know. Also, there are so many
reasons why the royal family wanted her dead
considering the massive popularity and influence she
would continue to hold for the foreseeable future. We
have seen how much control and power the royal
family has and we have also seen they will do
anything to protect it. I do not know what specific
evidence led me to believe the conspiracy theory. I
think it was a gradual accumulation of the events
through watching documentaries and reading new
stories about it. After learning about how much power
and influence the royal family has and the problems
Diana was causing, it seemed to make sense that they
would want her dead and could make it happen. Also,
considering the nature of the death, it is plausible that
something more was going on.

This cluster of statements revolves around the
conspiracy theory that Princess Diana's death was not
accidental but orchestrated. Many assertions suggest
that her death was planned due to various reasons: her
knowledge of royal family secrets, her relationship
with Dodi Al-Fayed, and her overall popularity and
influence that posed a threat to the monarchy.
Theorie(43)s include involvement by Prince Charles,
the broader royal family, or other powerful entities,
with motives ranging from allowing Charles to
remarry, to silencing Diana due to her outspokenness
and potential revelations about the royal family.
Suspicious details cited include anomalies in the crash
investigation, like malfunctioning tunnel cameras,
unusual levels of driver intoxication, delayed
emergency response, and Diana's own premonitions
about a car accident. Some theories extend to
suggesting that the royal family's displeasure with
Diana's actions or relationships prompted them to
facilitate her death.

Highly
Polarized

1.6

1.1

The education department of the US is deeply slanted
to immoral curriculum in our schools and groom
children to extreme left wing views. The education of
children should not be a nonprofit effort by the
government to manipulate the knowledge and
emotions in a progressive direction. The low instances
of trans genderism is fostered by schools and liberal
teachers which is pulling these misguided children
further off track and this catastrophe is fed by the
department of education.

These statements reflect various conspiracy theories
and critical perspectives regarding the actions and
motivations of political parties, groups, and individuals
in the United States. They suggest deliberate strategies
by Republicans and Democrats to manipulate societal
norms, election outcomes, and governmental structures
for ideological gains or power consolidation. These
theories range from efforts to reshape the judiciary and
educational systems to influence over immigration
policies and national identity. They underscore a deep
polarization and mistrust in the political discourse,
where each side accuses the other of undermining
democracy, civil liberties, and the nation's foundational
values.
